## Basics in Math
### Probability theory
- [**Probability theory and examples**](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf)
  The Bible in probability theory. It introduces the essential definition of probability by the language of measure theory. From this book, you would have an understanding about some foundamental concepts in probability theory, e.g. random variable, sample space, stocastic process, martingale, expectation, Law of large number, central limit theorem, Gaussian process, Markov process, etc. 


- [**High dimensional probability theory**](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html) 
  In the field of learning theory (generative cabability, sample complexity, statistical convergence rate, etc), this book is almost a must-have for everyone. It introduces many basic inequalities in probability theory, e.g. Markov inequality, Chebysheve Inequality, Gaussian Concentration Inequality, etc, and related concepts, e.g. Sub-Gaussian distribution, log-concave distribution.  
  

### Information theory
- [**Element of information theory**](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/Wiley.Interscience.Elements.of.Information.Theory.Jul.2006.eBook-DDU.pdf)
  This book is a classical introduction reference in field of information theory. It introduces many basic information concepts, e.g. Entropy, mutual information, KL-divergence, etc and their interpretation in information theory. For ML reseacher, it is good to know these interpretations.  

- [**Concentration of Measure Inequalities in Information Theory, Communications and Coding (Second Edition)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4663) 
  It is an easy to read Monograph. It introduces many basic measure concentration inequalities, optimal transportation inequalities and information inequalities and their relations, e.g. the famous Talagrand inequaliy, HWI inequalities, logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, etc. 


### Functional analysis 
- [**Functional Analysis (Math 920) Lecture Notes**](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/schenke6/920/920notes.pdf)
- [**Lecture Notes on Functional Analysis: With Applications to Linear Partial Differential Equation**](https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-143)
  An easy to read lecture note. It introduces many foundamental inequalities, that is widely used in probability theory, measure concentration and informaiton theory (e.g. Minkovski inequlity). It also introduces many basic concepts in optimization, e.g. dual space, Riesz representation theorem, weak topology (weak convergence etc.).
