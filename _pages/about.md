# About Me  
I am a postdoctoral research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, working under the guidance of Dr. [Soheil Kolouri](https://skolouri.github.io). I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware in 2022. Before that, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics at Marshall University in West Virginia in 2016 and my B.Sc. in Medical Imaging at Mudanjiang Medical University, China, in 2012.  

# Research Interests  
My research primarily focuses on computational optimal transport and its applications in computer vision, statistics, and machine learning. During my Ph.D., I worked on measure concentration and information theory. Recently, I have been exploring the intersection of optimal transport with generative models, time series, and other areas for broader scientific applications, including bioinformatics.
