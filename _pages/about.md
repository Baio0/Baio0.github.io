I am a postdoctoral research assistant at Vanderbilt University's Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab, under the guidance of Dr. [Soheil Kolouri](https://skolouri.github.io). I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware in 2022. Prior to this, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics at Marshall University in West Virginia in 2016, and my B.Sc. in Medical Imaging at Mudanjiang Medical University, China, in 2012. My research focuses on computational optimal transport and its applications in fields like computer vision, statistics, and machine learning.
